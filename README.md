# CGPA-Calculator-Web-Application
A simple fun project!

While learning JavaScript, I had a sudden thought: why not build a fun project with my beginner knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
By using the CGPA Calculator WebApp, you can calculate your CGPA and generate a formally styled grade sheet that can be printed or saved as a PDF.

As a university student, I often feel the need to calculate my CGPA for two main reasons:

  1. To get an approximate idea of my result after finishing a semester final exam.
  2. To plan my study roadmap for a running semester, so I can understand my current preparation and how much effort I need to reach my target CGPA.
